<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a hardworking and driven individual who has been financially independent since the age of 18, supporting both my education in the U.S. 
  and my family. My journey has been anything but linear. I initially pursued a degree in Business, unsure of my true calling. However, 
  my passion for coding and problem-solving led me to transition into Computer Science, where I thrived. Graduating summa cum laude with a 
  Bachelor of Science, I became the first in my extended family to earn a degree, and even more significantly, a science degree using my 
  second language: English. 
  As a first-generation graduate and a woman in tech, I take immense pride in breaking barriers and paving the way for others.</p>

<p>Life has presented me with many challenges, but I have always found ways to overcome them. 
  My experiences have shaped my resilience and adaptability, teaching me the value of hard work, smart decisions, and perseverance. 
  I find joy in the small details of life and am deeply motivated by my desire to create meaningful impact, both through my work and by 
  giving back to those in need. My love for coding goes beyond just a profession; it is a passion that fuels my drive to build, innovate, 
  and solve problems.</p>

<p>I am currently seeking a better opportunity where my skills and contributions are valued in a supportive and growth-oriented environment. 
  While I have gained valuable experience in my current role, I have come to realize the importance of working in a place that fosters innovation,
  respects talent, and treats people with kindness. I believe that a healthy work environment not only enhances productivity but also allows 
  individuals to thrive and make a real impact. I am eager to bring my dedication, problem-solving skills, and passion for development to a team
  that appreciates hard work and cultivates a culture of mutual respect and collaboration.</p>
